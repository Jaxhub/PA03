This app contains methods that allow the user to store information and into a table that is easibly editable. Users will be able to view all their input and sort that input. 
My pytest was sucessful as it contained 6/6 passed test. I did have minor issues that I had to fix within my code so my pytest did not take long. 
The tracker class was sucessful and it allows the user to use the sql functionality of the transaction class. This class took the longest time for me to figure out how to add all the fucntionality. 
I am not in a group so all the methods written were created by me.
I was not able to get the best score for my pylint I only reached a best of 6.82. 
Tracker.py was a sucess as I was able to run it in my terminal and the methods worked as intended
